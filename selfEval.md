# Self Evaluation

- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area?

I've found that I will catch myself spending too much time on Slack when I run out of enthusiasm for a lesson. This tends to be when I'm reading the lesson file. Once I start the coding challenges, I usually start to focus more. Since I want to contribute to helping my peers, I'm somewhat conflicted about responding to someone else asking for help when I'm in the middle of something, but I guess that just comes with the territory of being a programmer on a team. For anyone else thinking about the same thing, I guess I would encourage them to stay aware of the time being spent on Slack so that is spent proportionally to your priorities.

- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is?

A function is like a toolkit sitting in the garage. We don't see it inside the house and it doesn't change anything inside until we decide we want to go get it from the garage, bring it inside, and use it to fix something.

- Share your understanding of arguments and parameters.

Parameters are the total number of inputs available for a function. They each have unique names, so that they can be referred to inside the function's code block. When we call a function, we call it alongside arguments that correspond to the available inputs (parameters) of the function. The values of these arguments are then substituted for the parameters inside the function's code block for that instance.

- What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to being to your Small Group?

Can we refer to a variable inside a function's code block that has been declared further up the entire code base? Further down the code base?
